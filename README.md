# 🏦 Bank Solution – SOLID Principles in Practice  

This repository is a **Bank Solution** designed to demonstrate and apply the **SOLID design principles** through practical and realistic examples.  
The core idea is to **show common design issues (Anti-Patterns)** and then restructure the same project within the solution by applying the correct principles, highlighting the difference between **bad design vs clean design**.  

---

## 📌 What You’ll Find in This Project
- 🔴 **Projects with design issues** (violating SOLID principles).  
- 🟢 **Refactored projects** fixed by applying SOLID + other principles such as **KISS** and **YAGNI**.  
- 💡 A clear **before & after comparison** to understand the impact of proper design.  

---

## 🧱 Principles Covered
This solution includes practical implementations of:  

1. **SRP – Single Responsibility Principle**  
   - Demonstrates how multiple responsibilities in one class increase complexity.  
   - Refactored by splitting responsibilities into separate classes.  

2. **OCP – Open/Closed Principle**  
   - Shows how to extend system behavior without modifying core code.  

3. **LSP – Liskov Substitution Principle**  
   - Highlights inheritance issues and how to refactor them properly.  

4. **ISP – Interface Segregation Principle**  
   - Solves the problem of **fat interfaces** by splitting them into smaller, focused ones.  

5. **DIP – Dependency Inversion Principle**  
   - Demonstrates the difference between depending on details vs abstractions.  

6. **KISS & YAGNI**  
   - Practical application of “Keep It Simple” and “You Aren’t Gonna Need It”.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- C#  
- .NET Framework  
- Windows Forms (for some examples)  
- SQL Server (in data-related cases)  

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose
- Strengthen understanding of **SOLID principles** through **hands-on examples**, not just theory.  
- Help developers **spot common design mistakes** and learn how to fix them.  
- Provide a **Bank Solution** that serves as a reference for learning and practice.
